title: "Baby sensory bottles"

I made a set of 12 baby sensory bottles for 9 month old Katie. The bottles came from a set of 12 little bottles of shampoo, the sort you would get in a hotel room.

Each bottle is supposed to have an interesting and different look, weight, smell or sound.

Practically, I just used up all the bottles, washed and dried them. I especially had to dry the one that contain powder so the powder didn't clump. After filling them I put epoxy resin glue into the inside of the thread, so that the lids are permanently closed. I chose [Gorilla epoxy glue](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Gorilla-Glue-6044001-25ml-Epoxy/dp/B009NQQJFC) because it's non-toxic once set. I don't expect the glue ever to be exposed but I wanted to make sure it wouldn't give off any bad smells or be toxic if I somehow comes loose.

Here are the bottles I chose to make:

- *Cotton wool* - Almost weightless.
- *Oil and vinegar* - Shake to mix then separates back into dark and light liquids.
- *Pasta shapes* - Makes a nice sound.
- *Polystyrene balls* - Very light but makes a sound when shaked.
- *Sticks* - Make a sound and are pleasing to shake.
- *[Bells](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Hot-Sale-50Pcs-lot-Colorful-Iron-Loose-Beads-Small-Jingle-Bells-Christmas-Decoration-Pendants-DIY-Crafts/32726160762.html?spm=2114.13010608.0.0.AW6Zhl)* - Are colourful and make a sound.
- *Cloves and cinnamon* - Made a tiny hole in the bottle to let the smell out.
- *[Balls](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/50pcs-10-12mm-Pearl-Shaped-Soft-Crystal-Soil-Grow-Magic-Jelly-Ball-Hydrogel-Water-Beads-Plant/32726644313.html?spm=2114.13010608.0.0.AW6Zhl)* - Balls that move around and settle to the bottom, but don't make a sound.
- *[Tiny ladybird toys](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/6-piece-More-meat-micro-landscape-ornaments-accessories-ornaments-ornaments-wood-crafts-Ladybird-Beetle-Coccinella/32658864790.html?spm=2114.13010608.0.0.bhFNRE)* - Look interesting and make a sound.
- *Soy sauce* - Liquid covers the inside of the bottle when shaked.
- *Sugar* - Fine powder is fun to shake.
- *Water with red food colouring* - Is heavy and behaves like water.

I spent a few months making the list, adding interesting things as I thought of them. Some of the items are not easy to get a hold of so I added links where to buy them. Nothing cost more than a pound to make, so it's a really good value gift for a baby and is very satisfying to make.

Here's a big picture for people who want a close up.
