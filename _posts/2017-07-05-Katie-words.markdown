* Nappy
* Aya (Alison)
* Ta
* Banana
* Ham

* Hello
* Hiya
* Celtic
* Jump
* Chute
* Frog

plus animal noises for particular animals:

* Woof
* Roar
* Ooh aah (monkey)
* Twit twoo 

and songs she can sing to the tune so they are recognisable, although the the words are garbled:

* All day long
* Horsey horsey

I have probably missed a few ones but I think that's about right.
