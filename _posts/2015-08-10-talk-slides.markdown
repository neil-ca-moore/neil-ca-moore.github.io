In [this post]({% post_url 2014-11-30-objects-and-pointers %}) and [this post]({% post_url 2015-06-10-objects-and-pointers-2 copy %}) I wrote about pointers, objects and polymorphism. I did talk at [C++ Edinburgh](http://cppedinburgh.uk) about those posts. [Here are the slides](https://slate.adobe.com/a/REYAE) (created with [Adobe Slate](https://standout.adobe.com/slate/)!)
