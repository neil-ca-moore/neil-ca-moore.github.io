Did the 10k in Glasgow last weekend. It had been a while since I got under 45 mins for a 10k. I didn't manage this time either. It took me 45 mins and 9 seconds. I didn't pace myself properly and had too much to do at the end.

In the past I've done the Glasgow 10k in 45 mins & 13 seconds (2013) and in 24 mins & 47 seconds (2014).
