I phoned every surveyor I could find in St Andrews and asked them for the price of an EPC certificate.

This data is obviously only accurate at the time of writing.

standrewspropertycentre - £120 incl VAT
Allied Surveyors Scotland - £132 incl VAT
Shepherd Chartered Surveyors - £125 incl VAT 
Bradburne Chartered Surveyors - £126 incl VAT

I also found openrent.co.uk that charged £69 incl VAT.

Their service was excellent and they also offer other fixed prices landlord services like gas safety, etc.

Hopefully somebody will be searching for the price of an EPC in St Andrews at some point and they will realise that it's not worth calling the surveyors.
