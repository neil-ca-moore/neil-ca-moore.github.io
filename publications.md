[^1]: Also an HP Labs technical report [here](http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/2011/HPL-2011-235.html)
[^2]: Supersedes CIRCA preprint "Learning implied constraints lazily". [Click here](/resources/lazyData.zip) for experimental data and instances.
[^3]: This pretty much supersedes my dissertation, since it is more complete and more precise.
[^4]: 
	I was shortlisted for the Science, Engineering and Technology award for Computational Sciences. The award was sponsored by Microsoft. I didn't win but the entry was a good introduction to my species trees work, without going into the gory details.

	I went on a trip to London for the judging with my Dad, and we had a nice time although I didn't win.

[^5]: My dissertation was supervised by Patrick Prosser. Patrick gave me the problem to work on, which was something he has been working on for a few years. We made great progress together. We also spent the summer working on related problems; we subsequently published our work in JAIR.
