I am giving a talk at the event [Lost in Translation: Early Career Researchers moving from academia to industry](http://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/lost-in-translation-early-career-researchers-moving-from-academia-to-industry-tickets-7269436079) at St Andrews university on the 14th of October. I'm writing this post to get my thoughts together about how I made the transition and any advice I might have for others to help them decide what is right for them.

It's going to be partly an introduction to myself but I'll try to give not only what worked for me but try to give some reasoning that will help other people too. The personal details should help make sense of what I'm saying.

Outline:
- who am I?
 - PhD
 - HP Labs
  - represents the first route into industry, i.e. uni-industrial partnership, dip the toe in
 - Adobe
  - another route into industry, jumping in head first
 - ...?
  - don't know but likely not academia again, hopefully more in the direction of research again..
  - I cannot comment on how easy it is to move back...
- high level
 - characteristics of industry, i.e. money as an aim
 - characteristics of academia, more diffuse purposes
- types of role in industry
- types of industries
- what I love about industry
 - interest in what I do
  - lots of people using my stuff
  - people love it and are deeply interested that it 
 - job availability, security, salary and flexibility of location etc.
 - working within more stringent constraints
  - less individualistic
  - priorities are more frequently set externally
  - the problems are typically simpler, but have a high degree of complicating factors 
   - like time constraints, legacy code and the requirement for total perfection in usability, but also pragmatism
- what frightened me before I took the plunge
 - abandoning career and feeling a failure
  - just because you can have an academic career doesn't mean you have to
  - nobody cares about your research as such
   - but I found that I didn't care about that
   - don't fall into the sunk cost fallacy
  - nobody cares about how clever you've been, sometime you are successful by being stupid and getting it done
- what still bothers me
 - loss of autonomy and free time
  - flipside is that the existence of 9-5 helps ground your schedule and get back your free time
 - stagnating research skills and loss of route back
- conclusion
 - main advantages of industry
  - different work you may prefer
  - salary + job availability
 - main advantages of academia
  - self indulgence
  - eventual job security
 - if you love what you're doing, keep doing it if you can
 - if you don't then try something new
  - even if you do want to stay in academia, please consider abandoning your research area
   - even Donald Knuth has never used his PhD skills at all
   - you must be unsentimental about your previous work
   - your previous skills make you distinctive when you do something new, even if there is a new learning curve
  - we are in a luxury industry where skills are in demand, you can make mistakes
  - as far as I'm concerned I lost nothing but doing a PhD
  - if I'd kept flogging the dead horse then I would have been losing out

# Who am I?

Since I left the University of Glasgow with a Computing Science degree I have worked in three places.

## St Andrews

My PhD in St Andrews directly lead from the work I did in my final year of my undergraduate degree. I had been working on the constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) for my final year project. I decided to do a PhD because I was enjoying doing academic research and enjoyed being at University. I didn't want it to stop so I started looking for a PhD place. I was lucky enough to work in St Andrews with a fantastic research group containing Ian Gent, Ian Miguel, Chris Jefferson, Pete Nightingale and Lars Kotthoff.

I don't think I struggled with my PhD more than I should have. It has to be hard or it's not worthwhile. However I don't think it came naturally to me, I had to struggle and I felt like I could only ever become a mediocre researcher. Hence towards the end of my three and a half years I began to feel that while I was likely to pass my PhD, I was not sure that a postdoc was right for me.

## HP Labs

I got essentially the simplest possible transition into industry via HP Labs in Bristol. There was a project there that called for the application of CSP techniques to security problems. This was an Industrial Mathematics knowledge transfer project, hence it was funded partly by EPSRC and partly by HP Labs. The project is described [here](https://connect.innovateuk.org/web/partnership-programmes/article-view/-/blogs/automatic-policy-enforcement-exchange). Hence I was able to dip my toe into industry while getting 6 months in industry. I would heartily recommend this to PhD student. I did mine at the end of my PhD once I'd already completed my thesis. I'm not sure whether it would have been a good idea to do this in the middle of my PhD, it might have caused me to lose momentum..

Hence I had the opportunity to change just one variable at a time. I got to take my existing research area but apply it in industry instead of academia. How did the experiment turn out?

It was intended to be applied research with the potential of being sold to customers in a few years. I worked with some brilliant people like Helen Balinsky, David Subiros Perez and Steve Simske. While somewhere like HP Labs does value basic research, it is never research for its own sake. They valued techniques provided they worked, but had no sentimentality. Their target was 

- quality demo's to enable to research to transition to a saleable product, and
- patents.

and to a lesser extent also published papers.

I liked my work and the people at HP Labs but the location in Bristol was not ideal. I got used to having plenty of money unlike when I was a PhD student, which perhaps made it even less likely I'd go back to academia. Hence I interviewed with Adobe, liked the people and decided to see how that worked out.

## Adobe

The work I have done at Adobe has not followed on from anything I have done previously. I could have got practically the same job straight after my undergraduate degree. However the research, engineering and pragmatism that I learned at St Andrews and HP Labs definitely gave me a head start.
