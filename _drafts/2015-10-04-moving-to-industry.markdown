I am giving a talk at the event [Lost in Translation: Early Career Researchers moving from academia to industry](http://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/lost-in-translation-early-career-researchers-moving-from-academia-to-industry-tickets-7269436079) at St Andrews university on the 14th of October. I'm writing this post to get my thoughts together about how I made the transition and any advice I might have for others to help them decide what is right for them.

It's going to be partly an introduction to myself but I'll try to give not only what worked for me but try to give some reasoning that will help other people too. The personal details should help make sense of what I'm saying.

Outline:
- who am I?
 - PhD
 - HP Labs
  - represents the first route into industry, i.e. uni-industrial partnership, dip the toe in
 - Adobe
  - another route into industry, jumping in head first
 - ...?
  - don't know but likely not academia again, hopefully more in the direction of research again..
  - I cannot comment on how easy it is to move back...
- high level
 - characteristics of industry, i.e. money as an aim
 - characteristics of academia, more diffuse purposes
- types of role in industry
- types of industries
- what I love about industry
 - interest in what I do
  - lots of people using my stuff
  - people love it and are deeply interested that it 
 - job availability, security, salary and flexibility of location etc.
 - working within more stringent constraints
  - less individualistic
  - priorities are more frequently set externally
  - the problems are typically simpler, but have a high degree of complicating factors 
   - like time constraints, legacy code and the requirement for total perfection in usability, but also pragmatism
- what frightened me before I took the plunge
 - abandoning career and feeling a failure
  - just because you can have an academic career doesn't mean you have to
  - nobody cares about your research as such
   - but I found that I didn't care about that
   - don't fall into the sunk cost fallacy
  - nobody cares about how clever you've been, sometime you are successful by being stupid and getting it done
- what still bothers me
 - loss of autonomy and free time
  - flipside is that the existence of 9-5 helps ground your schedule and get back your free time
 - stagnating research skills and loss of route back
- conclusion
 - main advantages of industry
  - different work you may prefer
  - salary + job availability
 - main advantages of academia
  - self indulgence
  - eventual job security
 - if you love what you're doing, keep doing it if you can
 - if you don't then try something new
  - we are in a luxury industry where skills are in demand, you can make mistakes
  - as far as I'm concerned I lost nothing but doing a PhD
  - if I'd kept flogging the dead horse then I would have been losing out
