I am giving a talk at the event [Lost in Translation: Early Career Researchers moving from academia to industry](http://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/lost-in-translation-early-career-researchers-moving-from-academia-to-industry-tickets-7269436079) at St Andrews university on the 14th of October. I'm writing this post to get my thoughts together about how I made the transition and any advice I might have for others to help them decide what is right for them.

It's going to be partly an introduction to myself but I'll try to give not only what worked for me but try to give some reasoning that will help other people too. The personal details should help make sense of what I'm saying.

  - even if you do want to stay in academia, please consider abandoning your research area
   - even Donald Knuth has never used his PhD skills at all
   - you must be unsentimental about your previous work
   - your previous skills make you distinctive when you do something new, even if there is a new learning curve

# Who am I?

Since I left the University of Glasgow with a Computing Science degree I have worked in three places.

## St Andrews

<img src="/resources/academia-post/st_and.svg" width="100">

My PhD in St Andrews directly lead from the work I did in my final year of my undergraduate degree. I had been working on the constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) for my final year project. I decided to do a PhD because I was enjoying doing academic research and enjoyed being at University. I didn't want it to stop so I started looking for a PhD place. I was lucky enough to work in St Andrews with a fantastic research group containing Ian Gent, Ian Miguel, Chris Jefferson, Pete Nightingale and Lars Kotthoff.

I don't think I struggled with my PhD more than I should have. It has to be hard or it's not worthwhile. However I don't think it came naturally to me, I had to struggle and I felt like I could only ever become a mediocre researcher. Hence towards the end of my three and a half years I began to feel that while I was likely to pass my PhD, I was not sure that a postdoc was right for me.

## HP Labs

<img src="/resources/academia-post/HP_labs.png" width="100">

I got essentially the simplest possible transition into industry via HP Labs in Bristol. There was a project there that called for the application of CSP techniques to security problems. This was an Industrial Mathematics knowledge transfer project, hence it was funded partly by EPSRC and partly by HP Labs. The project is described [here](https://connect.innovateuk.org/web/partnership-programmes/article-view/-/blogs/automatic-policy-enforcement-exchange). Hence I was able to dip my toe into industry while getting 6 months in industry. I would heartily recommend this to PhD student. I did mine at the end of my PhD once I'd already completed my thesis. I'm not sure whether it would have been a good idea to do this in the middle of my PhD, it might have caused me to lose momentum..

Hence I had the opportunity to change just one variable at a time. I got to take my existing research area but apply it in industry instead of academia. How did the experiment turn out?

It was intended to be applied research with the potential of being sold to customers in a few years. I worked with some brilliant people like Helen Balinsky, David Subiros Perez and Steve Simske. While somewhere like HP Labs does value basic research, it is never research for its own sake. They valued techniques provided they worked, but had no sentimentality. Their target was 

- quality demo's to enable to research to transition to a saleable product, and
- patents.

Also to a lesser extent also published papers.

I liked my work and the people at HP Labs but the location in Bristol was not ideal. I got used to having plenty of money unlike when I was a PhD student, which perhaps made it even less likely I'd go back to academia. Hence I interviewed with Adobe, liked the people and decided to see how that worked out.

## Adobe

<img src="/resources/academia-post/Adobe.svg" width="100">

The work I have done at Adobe has not followed on from anything I have done previously. I could have got practically the same job straight after my undergraduate degree. However the research, engineering and pragmatism that I learned at St Andrews and HP Labs definitely gave me a head start.

From the day I started at Adobe I have been extremely happy. From day one I have been shipping code to appreciative customers and working with great colleagues who have taught me how to work efficiently and achieve a high quality standard.

I was lucky enough to have something I worked on from my second day at Adobe demonstrated at the [Adobe MAX](https://max.adobe.com/) keynote talk. From there I ended up working the strategically important file sync component of the Creative Cloud. File sync was demonstrated at Adobe MAX, along with [Typekit Desktop sync](https://typekit.com/fonts?licenses=deskto) which I was also tangentially involved with. I have also been lucky enough to give talks at two internal conferences, ship countless versions of our software to literally millions of machines (/usually/ without incident). I have volunteered to go to the USA so many times that I've lost count and seen great places like San Francisco, Los Angeles and Seattle in the process.

This has made things varied, but the day to day process of specifying, writing and testing software has been what has captured my passion.

## Future

I don't know what the future holds, but I do know that I will be staying in industry and not returning to academia. I would probably enjoy a greater element of applied research in my work, but for the moment the 10 year project of becoming a great engineer is still underway.

I am not sure if I would be able to return to return to academia if I wanted to. I have known people to do so, but I am not sure if I would be capable of it. I do know that if I was to do research again then I would be much more focussed on end product. This is what I have learned to do in industry where speed is essential.

# High level characteristics of industry and academia

I want to say what I think characterises each type of workplace.

## Industry

In industry everything is driven directly or indirectly by the need to make money sustainably. That may sound excessively cynical but I think it's true. It's a bit like how evolution of species is driven by brutality but can also have redeeming features.

The positive side effects of this focus include

- focus on customer experience,
- focus on finding methods that deliver good results irrespective of their novelty, and
- focus on teamwork.

However some aspects of good software development become guidelines rather than strict requirements. Unit testing, good software design, documentation and code hygiene may be sacrified to achieve faster progress. Short term progress is traded off against maintainability.

Engineers must justify the use of their time. Dogmatisms like 100% test coverage are not accepted automatically and must prove their worth.

But enough tributes to capitalism. What about the friendly, cuddly world of academia?

## Academia

The aims of academia are more diverse. 

Turning out well educated students is a primary aim. That is valuable for a variety of reasons only tangentially related to money. A well educated populace are well behaved and fertilise successful industry. Early career researchers have a supporting role but my feeling is that education is mostly left to more established academics. 

Academic research is the other aim. Academic research is really what early stage researchers are spending their time doing. In my opinion such research is not for making money but rather to

- take people's undergraduate education to the next level;
- provide a vibrant background for teaching;
- to satisfy the innate need to discover and communicate;
- national vanity; and 
- to provide ideas and people to industry.

By stating my opinions on the value of academia I am seeking to lay bare why it has different characteristics than industry as a job.

You see relaxed and self indulgent styles of work in academia that are seldom seen in industry. That is because the aim is not necessarily to be as productive as possible in terms of end product, but to maximise much more nebulous aims as novelty, engagement and elegance.

## Vive la difference

This is why academia is not exactly like industry. There is a lot of creativity in industry but directed towards business success. There is a lot of efficient working practices in academia but directed towards novelty. However the flavour is very different.

# What I love about working in industry

I've explained that I like working in industry, I'm going to go into a bit more detail on why.

The main thing is that I like the engagement levels in industry. It's unusual for somebody not to care deeply about whatever you are working on and to be intensely interested in the results. There are frequent milestones around features, bug fixes, releases and so on. Hence there are frequent small milestones to give satisfaction every day. I felt academic research worked to longer time horizons of papers, grants and so on. Milestones in academia are much more difficult so they come along less often. You just cannot be finding novelty every day.

The other side of engagement is that you are typically producing software that is important to customers (external or internal). Customers care whether it works as their own livelihood or free time depends on it. In academia often papers can develop very little interest, I'm sure everyone has had that experience of being ignored. Some papers have a great impact that changes the world, most do not. Papers may turn out to be relevant only a niche group. 

I must mention that industry has been more financially lucrative for me. I think it is for most people. In academia you can aim for a permanent academic job, which is the closest thing to a job for life that exists today. However many people fail to achieve that goal. The computer industry has a high level of demand for qualified staff and I think that the chances of a hard working and qualified person ending up redundant is low compared to other industries. Over the course of a career computer scientists in industry will earn significantly more in most cases.

The sorts of problems one is solving in industry are often conceptually simpler. There are people in industry doing advanced research, but novelty is generally not an aim. Novelty is valued if it can be patented or is something that customers will want, but is not valued for its own sake. Most business problems are not particularly new, and engineers are distinguished by their ability to solve these simple problems quickly and efficiently. Even Google engineers are mostly working on the programming equivalent of sweeping the floor.

The type of perfection required in industry is different. Making code work on every conceivable platform, for every locale, for every possible input etc. is highly valued. My experience of academic software engineering is that the code is generally only used by its creator(s) hence it doesn't have to be bug free or simple to use. There is a learning curve and unique discipline to writing code that is outwardly perfect. I say outwardly perfect because the perfect interface can hide a lot of bad code underneath it.

Picking a job at the right level of novelty and challenge is a difficult task. You may have to take a pay cut to work on what you want. Being able to tolerate boring work is a skill that is financially rewarded, and every engineer must decide her own priorities.

Autonomy is one of the great attractions of academia. Freedom to
